# Nero — AI-Powered Web3 Companion

**Learn Web3 as You Use It. Pay Only for Real Value.**

## Overview

**Nero** is an **AI-powered Web3 onboarding companion** optimized for the
**Movement Network (M2, MoveVM)** ecosystem.

Nero helps users understand complex Web3 concepts and interact with dApps
(such as DEXs, lending protocols, and Move-based applications) **in real time**,
directly within the context of what they are doing.

Instead of learning Web3 through documentation, tutorials, or expensive courses,
Nero enables users to **learn by using Web3**, guided by an AI companion that explains each step as it happens.

## Why Nero?

Web3 adoption fails not because users lack interest,
but because **help arrives too late**.

* Wallets, gas fees, approvals, and transactions overwhelm users
* Tutorials are generic and disconnected from real usage
* Courses are expensive and abandoned early
* Protocols spend heavily on onboarding, yet lose most users

**Nero solves this by becoming a real-time guide inside the Web3 experience itself.**

## Value Proposition

### 1. Learn for Free, Pay for Value

* Every user receives **daily free questions**
* After the free quota, users pay **per query** using small amounts of **MOVE**
* No subscriptions, no upfront commitment
* Users only pay **after value is delivered**

This model dramatically reduces onboarding friction and enables natural conversion.

### 2. Asset-Backed Learning

* User activity (questions, learning, payments) is accumulated into a
  **Nero Agent NFT**
* Learning progress becomes **on-chain growth**
* As the agent evolves, new capabilities are unlocked

Learning is no longer disposable—it becomes an asset.

### 3. Native Integration for Builders

* Developers can integrate Nero into their dApps using:
  * A lightweight SDK, or
  * A simple HTML snippet
* No need to build AI infrastructure
* Instantly adds:
  * User onboarding
  * In-app education
  * A new monetization layer

## Core Components
